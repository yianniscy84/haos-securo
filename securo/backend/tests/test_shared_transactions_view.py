"""End-to-end tests for the 'shared transactions become first-class
in the linked member's ledger' design:

  - Shared rows show up in /api/transactions for the linked member.
  - The viewer sees their share, not the parent's full amount.
  - Settlement-created debits are excluded from spending reports.
  - Owner doesn't see duplicates (they own the parent).
