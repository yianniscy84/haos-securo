"""rebucket credit card effective_dates to Brazilian close-day convention

Revision ID: 030
Revises: 029
Create Date: 2026-04-17

Per Brazilian banking convention (Nubank, Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, etc.),
a transaction dated ON the statement close day belongs to the NEXT invoice,
not the invoice closing that day. Securo's original formula bucketed these
transactions into the same-day close. This migration recomputes effective_date
for every transaction on every credit card that has both statement_close_day
and payment_due_day configured, using the corrected formula.

Accounts without both cycle days stay untouched (effective_date already
equals the transaction date for them — there's nothing to rebucket).
