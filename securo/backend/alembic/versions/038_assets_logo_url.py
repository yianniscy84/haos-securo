"""add logo_url to assets (cached favicon URL for market-priced assets)

Revision ID: 038
Revises: 037
Create Date: 2026-04-21

Stores a fully-formed logo URL so the frontend can render an <img> without
knowing about the upstream service. Populated at creation time for
market-priced assets when the quote provider returns a company website;
left null for manual assets and tickers without a website (most crypto).
