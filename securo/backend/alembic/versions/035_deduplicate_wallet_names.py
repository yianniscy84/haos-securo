"""disambiguate existing synced wallets with duplicate names

Revision ID: 035
Revises: 034
Create Date: 2026-04-20

Migration 034 auto-created one wallet per bank connection named after
the institution. Sandbox users hit the case where several connections
come back with the same institution_name (e.g. "MeuPluggy"), leaving
multiple identically-named wallets that are hard to tell apart.

This migration appends " 2", " 3", ... to the second+ occurrence of any
duplicated wallet name per user. Oldest wallet keeps the bare name (by
created-like order: the `id` UUIDv4 isn't time-ordered, so we fall back
to sort by `position` which was set by creation order in 034).

Runs once and is safe to re-run — it only touches rows whose name is
still exactly the duplicate base; wallets the user already renamed are
left alone.
