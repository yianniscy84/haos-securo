"""Chunking helper.

Tests cover:
  - empty / whitespace input → no chunks
  - text below target → single chunk
  - paragraph-aware splits stay close to the target size
  - overlap text appears at the start of subsequent chunks
  - very long single-paragraph fallback (hard split)
  - PDF / TXT mime extraction selection
