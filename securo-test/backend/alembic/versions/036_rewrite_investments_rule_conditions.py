"""rewrite Investimentos rule from a single regex to OR'd `contains` conditions

Revision ID: 036
Revises: 035
Create Date: 2026-04-20

The seed in 033 created one condition using a long pipe-separated regex.
That works but reads poorly in the rules UI — an unreadable wall of tokens
that users can't meaningfully edit. This migration rewrites any rule still
in that form into a list of OR'd `contains` conditions, one per keyword.
Semantically identical (the rule engine normalizes accents/case on both
sides), much easier to skim and tweak. Idempotent: rules already in the
new shape are left alone, and user-edited rules are only touched if they
still match the original single-regex signature.
