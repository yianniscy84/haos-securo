"""Group balance computation.

The model assumes the group owner is the implicit payer of every
transaction with splits — i.e. the `is_self` member of the group is the
one whose bank account holds the parent transaction.

For each non-self member M, we compute, per currency:
    + sum of M's split shares on owner-paid transactions      (M owes self)
    + settlements where from=self, to=M                       (self lent to M)
    - settlements where from=M, to=self                       (M paid self back)

A positive value means M owes the owner; negative means the owner owes M.
Mixed currencies are kept as separate lines — no FX conversion in v1.
